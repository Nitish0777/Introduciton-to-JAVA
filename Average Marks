Concept:-

If we want to calculate the average marks what we can do is:

1)Sum of all the Numbers
2)Divide by the total Numbers 

like:
    Numbers: 1,2,3;
    total Number: 3;
    aberage Number = (1+2+3/3)
    ans = 2;


public class Solution {


	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		/* Your class should be named Solution.
	 	* Read input as specified in the question.
	 	* Print output as specified in the question.
		*/
        Scanner sc =  new Scanner(System.in);
        char a = sc.next().charAt(0);
        int m1 = sc.nextInt();
        int m2 = sc.nextInt();
        int m3 = sc.nextInt();
        int average = (m1+m2+m3)/3;
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(average);
	}

}
